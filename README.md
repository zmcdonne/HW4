## Devlog
Write about how the model-view-control pattern is utilized in this project to keep the Player code decoupled from the other systems in this game. The model aspect of this game is less relevant, so you can skip describing it; however, the view and control aspects are very relevant, so you should describe which class defines the control side of this pattern, and which class defines the view side of this pattern.

Additionally, describe how events and a Singleton are used in your code to ensure the view and control aspects of your system are decoupled.

Make sure to cite your code (name specific classes, methods, and/or variables).
